			<h4>Review of project proposal (15%)</h4>
			<p>We will have a review for project proposals, to assist students better prepare their final projects. A revision is welcome after taking our suggestions into consideration.</p>

			<h4>Final project (40%)</h4>
			<p> The project could be done by a group but each indivisual is separately evaluated.    You need to write  a project report (max 6 pages) for the final project. 
				Here is the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/fvhykwvngdwz">report template</a>. You are also
				expected to make a project poster presentation. After the final project
				deadline, feel free to make your project open source; we  appreciate if you  acknowledge this course</p>

				</ul>

			</ul>
			<h4>Participation (5%)</h4>
			<p>Here are some ways to earn the participation credit, which is capped at 5%. </p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Attending guest lectures</b>: In the second half of the course, we have four invited speakers. We
					encourage students to attend the guest lectures and participate in Q&A. All students get 0.75% per
					guest lecture (in total 3%) for either attending in person, or by writing a guest lecture report if
					they attend remotely or watch the recording. </li>
				<li><b>Completing feedback surveys</b>: We will send out two feedback surveys during the semester to
				<li><b>User Study</b>: Students are welcone to conduct user study upon their interest; this is not mandatory (thus it does not affect final marks).</li>
				<li><b>Course and Teaching Evaluation (CTE)</b>: The school will send requests for CTE to all students.
					The CTE is worth 1% credit.</li>
				<!-- 				<li><b>Slack participation</b>: The top 10 contributors (10 from CSC3100 and 10 from MDS6002) to slack will get 1%; others will get credit in propotion to the 10th contributor. </li>
 -->
				<li><b>Volunteer credit (1%)</b>: TAs/instuctor can nominate students for a volunteer credit for those
					who help the poster session organization, or help answer questions from other students (not writing
					assignments). </li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Late Policy</h3>
			<p>The penalty is 0.5% off the final course grade for each late day.</p>
